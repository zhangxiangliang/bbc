## Question forms

### Meaning and Use

In English, there are two basic types of question.

1.Yes/no questions often begin with the verb to be, but can also begin with other auxiliary verbs, such as do. We ask these when we want a yes or no answer.

* Dave: Are you hungry?
* Mike: Yes, I’m starving. 

* Sarah: Did you get here on time?
* Emily: No, I missed the bus!

2.Wh-questions start with a question word, such as who, what, where, when, why or how. We ask this type of question when we want different kinds of information. These questions cannot be answered with a yes or no.

* Dave: Why are you so hungry?
* Mike: I didn’t eat breakfast.

* Sarah: When did you get here?
* Emily: About half an hour ago.

### Form

Yes/no questions that begin with the verb to be are made with to be + subject.

* Are you playing football tomorrow?
* Was the weather nice yesterday?

If we start with an auxiliary verb, the order is auxiliary + subject + main verb.

* Can Jenny speak Chinese?
* Did you go to the cinema on Saturday?

Wh-questions can be used to ask about the subject or object of the verb. Compare these questions:

* Who loves Lucy?
* Who does Lucy love?

For subject questions, the order is question word + verb + object.

* Who wants ice cream for dessert?
* Who broke the mirror in the dining room?
* Who answered the phone?

The object question form is question word + auxiliary + subject + verb.

* What did you do at the weekend?
* Where does your brother work?
* Who will you ask for help?

### Take Note
Asking questions with ‘how’

The question word how is usually combined with other words when asking for information, such as size, someone’s age, or the price of something.

* How big is your apartment?
* How old are your children now?
* How much is the black dress in the window?

### Spoken English

In formal situations, it is common to respond to a yes/no question by repeating the auxiliary in a complete sentence.

* Max: Can you use a computer?
* Jill: Yes, I can.

In casual spoken English, we do not need to repeat the auxiliary. Answers do not always contain 'yes' or 'no'.

* Peter: Do you know the way to the train station?
* William: Not really.

* Lucy: Shall we order sushi?
* Sally: Absolutely!

### Practice
