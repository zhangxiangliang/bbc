### Meaning and Use
### 解释与使用

In English, there are two basic types of question.

在英语中，有两种基本类型的提问方式。

1.Yes/no questions often begin with the verb to be, but can also begin with other auxiliary verbs, such as do. We ask these when we want a yes or no answer.

1.我们通常征求对方 是/否 的回答时，提问方式通常是以动词 be 开头，但是也可以使用助动词开头，例如 do。

* Dave: Are you hungry?
* Mike: Yes, I’m starving. 

* 你饿了吗？
* 是的，我饿死了。

* Sarah: Did you get here on time?
* Emily: No, I missed the bus!

* 你准时到了吗？
* 不，我错过了公交车

2. Wh-questions start with a question word, such as who, what, where, when, why or how. We ask this type of question when we want different kinds of information. These questions cannot be answered with a yes or no.

* Dave: Why are you so hungry?
* Mike: I didn’t eat breakfast.

* Sarah: When did you get here?
* Emily: About half an hour ago.

### Form
Yes/no questions that begin with the verb to be are made with to be + subject.

Are you playing football tomorrow?

Was the weather nice yesterday?

If we start with an auxiliary verb, the order is auxiliary + subject + main verb.

Can Jenny speak Chinese?
Did you go to the cinema on Saturday?

Wh-questions can be used to ask about the subject or object of the verb. Compare these questions:

Who loves Lucy?
Who does Lucy love?

For subject questions, the order is question word + verb + object.

Who wants ice cream for dessert?
Who broke the mirror in the dining room?
Who answered the phone?

The object question form is question word + auxiliary + subject + verb.

What did you do at the weekend?
Where does your brother work?
Who will you ask for help?

### Take Note
Asking questions with ‘how’

The question word how is usually combined with other words when asking for information, such as size, someone’s age, or the price of something.

How big is your apartment?
How old are your children now?
How much is the black dress in the window?

### Spoken English
In formal situations, it is common to respond to a yes/no question by repeating the auxiliary in a complete sentence.

Max: Can you use a computer?
Jill: Yes, I can.

In casual spoken English, we do not need to repeat the auxiliary. Answers do not always contain 'yes' or 'no'.

Peter: Do you know the way to the train station?
William: Not really.

Lucy: Shall we order sushi?
Sally: Absolutely!

### Practice
